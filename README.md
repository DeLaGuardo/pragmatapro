pragmatapro
===========
I don't know if in the future my font PragmataPro(TM) will be open source (I hope)
while you visit its web page for more informations and updates http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragmatapro.htm
and keep me informed about issues you found and suggestions to improve it

Many thanks!
Fabrizio Schiavi
